# Elm Library
A collection of links to various Elm resources and topics

### Motivation

Why build yet another collection of links if there's already [Awesome Elm](https://github.com/sporto/awesome-elm)? For my Elm Bits [newsletter](https://elmbits.com/) I send out a [special](https://elmbits.com/tag/special/) every 5th email, and these cover a specific topic, e.g. 3D, maps, testing. And I find it hard to sometimes go through all of the resources to find an article that explains one specific topic. So this is an attempt at categorizing user-generated content based on the topic covered.

### Adding new links

Feel free to create a pull request and add new links.
